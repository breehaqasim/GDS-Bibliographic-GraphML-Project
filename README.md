# GDS-Bibliographic-GraphML-Project

This project explores the application of **graph-based machine learning** techniques on a bibliographic dataset for two main tasks: **Node Classification** and **Link Prediction**. The dataset is extracted from bibliographic records, and the graph is constructed and analyzed using **Neo4j** and **Python-based ML frameworks**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Domain**: Bibliographic Data Analysis
- **Frameworks Used**: Neo4j, NetworkX, Scikit-learn, PyTorch Geometric (optional)
- **Languages**: Python, Cypher
- **Tasks**:
  - Node Classification: Classify papers/authors using graph structure
  - Link Prediction: Predict future collaborations or citations

## ðŸ§  Tasks Overview

### ðŸ”¸ Node Classification

Predict the topic or research area of a **Paper** or **Author** using graph structure and related attributes. Example tasks include:
- Classifying papers into topics based on citation networks.
- Predicting an author's expertise based on their co-authorship network.

### ðŸ”¸ Link Prediction

Predict future **collaborations** or **citation links** between entities using supervised or unsupervised link prediction models. Example use cases:
- Forecasting future co-authorship.
- Suggesting relevant citations for a given paper.
- Recommending suitable journals for paper submission.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

### Node Classification:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

### Link Prediction:
- **AUC-ROC**
- **Precision@K**
- **Recall@K**

## ðŸ“˜ Dataset Information

The dataset consists of the following CSV files:

- `authors.csv`: Author ID, Name, URL
- `journal.csv`: Journal Name, Publisher
- `paper.csv`: Paper ID, DOI, Title, Year, URL, Citation Count, Field of Study, Volume, Date
- `topic.csv`: Topic ID, Name, URL
- `paper_journal.csv`: Paper ID, Journal Name, Publisher
- `paper_topic.csv`: Paper ID, Topic ID
- `paper_reference.csv`: Paper ID, Referenced Paper ID

This dataset is derived from bibliographic research and is cited as follows:
